  Checkout Kata

Implement the code that calculates the total price of a basket of goods at a supermarket checkout. 
From week to week, special offers are introduced that apply discounts to multiple items: buy n, and they’ll cost
 y. For example, apples might cost 50 pence individually, but this week we have a special
offer: buy three apples and they’ll only cost you £1.00 - that's buy two, get one free!
 
This week’s prices are:

Item Unit | Price | Special Price
------------------------------
Apple | 50 | 3 for 130
Banana | 30 | 2 for 45
Pear | 20 |
Watermelon | 15 |

The checkout should apply deals regardless of what order the goods are scanned in.
